            <h2>About the Developer</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Comedy Movies Database! My name is Deepshikha sherpally, and I am the developer behind this website. I am currently a student at University of South Florida majoring in Business Analytics and information Systems(BAIS).</p>
            
            <h3>Professional Profile</h3>
            <p>I have a strong passion for web development and data analysis. Over the course of my studies, I have developed skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various other web technologies. I am always eager to learn and implement new technologies to create interactive and user-friendly websites.</p>
            
            <h3>Experience Developing This Website</h3>
            <p>Developing this website has been an enriching experience. I started by researching various comedy movies and gathering data on their ratings and main cast members. I then created a structured plan for the website, dividing it into several key sections: Home, About Us, Manage Movies (CRUD operations), and Data Analytics.</p>
            <p>The website is constructed using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. The Home page provides an overview of the comedy movies theme, while the About Us page offers insight into the developer's background and the technologies used. The Manage Movies page will allow users to perform mock CRUD operations, and the Data Analytics page will feature visualizations created using Chart.js or D3.js.</p>
            
            <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>Chart.js or D3.js for data visualizations</li>
            </ul>
